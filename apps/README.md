# Apps

This folder contains all my Android app projects. Each app includes its source code and a release APK of the latest version so you can try it out directly.

Feel free to:

- Explore the source code to learn how each app works.
- Build the apps yourself using Android Studio.
- Install the APKs on your device (make sure to enable installation from unknown sources).
